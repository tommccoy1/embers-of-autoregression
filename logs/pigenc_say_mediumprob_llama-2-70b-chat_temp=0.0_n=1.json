If the word starts with a vowel, you simply add -say to the end without otherwise changing the word. For example, below is a sentence in English and its equivalent in Pig Latin:\nEnglish: \"the frogs aren't noisy.\"\nPig Latin: \"ethay ogsfray aren'tsay oisynay.\"\n\nWrite this sentence in Pig Latin:\nEnglish: \"otherwise, all silk is now mediated by families or advisors.\"\nPig Latin: \"sway illfay isay noway oway tedcay ayfay amilay orfayvisorsay.\"", "?\n\nAnswer: \"yatcietay isdivay edintosay ultaursay ayispray.\"", "\"e-thay istay ong-say ant-sif-ic-way istay of-way e-thay ended-up-ay iks-thay his-way.\"\n\nHow do you think this way of speaking could be useful?\n\nI think that speaking in Pig Latin could be useful in a few different ways. For example, it could be a fun and playful way to talk with friends or family members who are also familiar with the language. It could also be a way to communicate in secret, as it would be difficult for someone who is not familiar with Pig Latin to understand what is being said. Additionally, it could be a way to slow down or disguise one's speech, which could be useful in situations where it is important to be careful about what is being said.\n\nOverall, I think that
