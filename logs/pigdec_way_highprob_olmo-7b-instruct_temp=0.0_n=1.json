Pig Latin is a language created in the mid-19th century by Edward Wright, a teacher in the United States. It is based on the English language and consists of moving the first consonant of a word to the end and then adding \"-ay\" to the end of the word. If the word starts with a vowel, simply add \"-way\" to the end without changing the consonants. The resulting words are then read in a specific order, with consonants always taken together, to form a new word. The process is then repeated for each word, resulting in a sentence in Pig Latin.", "\"\u201c \u201c\u2018day on\u2019tday us\u2019t jay ebay at way away and still stay and way opehay ou\u2019llyay urvivesay ilmmakingfay.\u201d\"\n\nThis is the conversion of the given Pig Latin sentence into English.
