To decode the message, you can use the same method as the encryption method.\n\nHere's the decoding process for the given message:\n\n1. \"Qyff\" becomes \"Follow\" (since Q is 20 letters ahead of F)\n2. \"Cn\" becomes \"Can\" (since C is 20 letters ahead of A)\n3. \"Qum\" becomes \"See\" (since Q is 20 letters ahead of S)\n4. \"Hin\" becomes \"Him\" (since H is 20 letters ahead of I)\n5. \"Y", "_______________\n\nThis is a more advanced version of the Caesar Cipher. Instead of simply shifting each letter by a fixed number of positions, you use a keyword to create a substitution cipher. To encrypt a message, you first convert each letter of the message to its corresponding number in the standard ordering of the alphabet (A=0, B=1, C=2, etc.). Then, you add the number of each letter of the keyword to the number of each letter of the message, modulo 26. Finally, you convert each number back to its corresponding letter in the standard ordering of the alphabet.\n\nFor example, if the keyword is \"mushroom\", then the message \"attack\" would be encrypted as follows:\n\nA = 0\nT = 1\nT = 1\nA = 0\nC = 3\nK = 11\n\nThe sum of the letters of the message and", "\n\nThis message is a bit more challenging than the previous one.

The key to this cipher is a number that indicates the number of positions to shift the letters. In this case, the key is 13.\n\nTo decode the message, you need to shift each letter back up the alphabet by 13 positions. For example, the letter \"h\" becomes \"n\" because it is 13 positions down from \"n\" in the alphabet. Similarly, the letter \"y\" becomes \"b\" because it is 13 positions down from \"b\" in the alphabet.\n\nHere is the decoded message:\nOriginal text: \"Come back here!\"\n\nI hope this helps!
