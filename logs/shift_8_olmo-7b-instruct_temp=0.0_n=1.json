first need to find the alphabet shift for each letter. Since the original text is \"Stay here!\" we can find the alphabet shift by looking at the first and last letters. The first letter is \"S\", and the last letter is \"!\", which are both in the second position of the alphabet. Therefore, the alphabet shift is 2.\n\nNow, let's decode each letter:\n\n* A: A = A + 2\n* B: B = B + 2\n* C: C = C + 2\n* D: D = D + 2\n* E: E = E + 2\n* F: F = F + 2\n* G: G = G + 2\n* H: H =", "The given message in Rot-8 is:\n\n\"Bw bpqa lig, em kwvbqvcm bw nwttwe bpmam xzqvkqxtma.\"\n\nTo decode the message, we can follow the rules of Rot-8 cipher:\n\n1.

If the shifted letter is not present in the alphabet, treat it as the letter 'X' and move on to the next letter.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the steps:\n\n1.

If the shifted letter is not present in the alphabet, treat it as the letter 'Z' and repeat the process for that letter.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the steps:\n\n1.
