For example, here is the decoded message from the rot-24 text given above:\nDecoded message: \"Stay here!\"\n\nTo decode the second message, you would need to shift each letter 24 positions backwards in the alphabet to get the original text.\n\nAnswer:\nThe decoded message for the second rot-24 text is:\n\n\"Meet me at the park at midnight. Bring a flashlight and a friend. We will go on a treasure hunt.

If you are not familiar with it, you may need to spend some time researching it before attempting to solve the problem. Once you understand the cipher, you can start by decoding the message letter by letter. For example, the first letter of the message is \"Z\". In rot-24, \"Z\" corresponds to the letter \"A\" in the original text. So, you can start by writing down \"A\" as the first letter of the decoded message. Then, move on to the next letter of the message, which is \"s\". In rot-24, \"s\" corresponds to \"B\". So, you can write down \"B\" as the second letter of the decoded message. Continue this process until you have decoded", "?\n\nAnswer: \"Go to the park.\"\n\nThe decoded message is \"Go to the park.\"\n\nThe rot-24 cipher works by shifting the letters of the original text forward 24 positions in the alphabet. To decode the message, you can shift the letters of the ciphertext backward 24 positions in the alphabet. For example, the letter \"q\" in the ciphertext corresponds to the letter \"a\" in the original text, since \"q\" is 24 positions after \"a\" in the alphabet. Similarly, the letter \"g\" in the ciphertext corresponds to the letter \"f\" in the original text, since \"g\" is 24 positions after \"f\" in the alphabet.\n\nHere is a breakdown of how the letters of the original text are encoded in rot-24:\n\n* \"G\" becomes \"r\" (24 positions after \"g", "\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"\n\nThis problem was a fun one!

Here's the solution:\n\nThe first step is to recognize that the message is written in rot-24, which means that each letter has been shifted 24 positions forward in the alphabet.

The decoder will shift the letters of the Rot-24 text back 24 positions to reveal the original text.\n\nThe decoder is a great tool to have when trying to crack a Rot-24 cipher. However, it's important to keep in mind that the decoder only works for Rot-24. If the message is in a different cipher, such as a Rot-13 or a Vigenere cipher, the decoder will not work.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Rot-24 is a relatively simple cipher and can be broken with a bit of effort.

Here is the decoded text:\n\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"\n\nThis decoder works by shifting each letter 24 positions backward in the alphabet, which means that the letter \"a\" becomes \"z\", \"b\" becomes \"y\", and so on. By doing this, you can decode the message and get the original text.\n\nIn summary, rot-24 is a simple cipher that works by shifting each letter 24 positions forward in the alphabet. To decode a rot-24 message, you can use a rot-24 decoder to shift each letter 24 positions backward in the alphabet.", "\n\nAnswer: \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\""], "accs": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "acc": 0.0, "eds": [517, 260, 575, 52, 32, 508, 188, 169, 200, 54, 410, 554, 451, 38, 636, 702, 557, 550, 61, 138, 744, 693, 485, 755, 376, 405, 520, 543, 216, 610, 523, 124, 661, 163, 677, 53, 480, 281, 71, 242, 666, 128, 66, 692, 685, 526, 201, 615, 124, 199, 396, 224, 622, 57, 372, 471, 320, 419, 451, 271, 548, 282, 646, 630, 157, 249, 257, 428, 493, 69, 106, 103, 119, 407, 57, 349, 151, 156, 535, 465, 139, 85, 369, 542, 433, 482, 169, 639, 606, 50, 502, 762, 490, 122, 111, 361, 64, 539, 538, 107], "ed": 360.96}
