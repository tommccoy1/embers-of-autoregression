In Pig Latin, the letters in the words are not changed, but they are rearranged so that the first consonant (or consonant cluster) is moved to the end of the word and the sound \"ay\" is added. In the example you gave, the word \"inhay\" is the Pig Latin version of \"in the\". The word \"ethay\" is the Pig Latin version of \"the\". \"Occurredhay\" is the Pig Latin version of \"occurred\". \"Owledgeknay\" is the Pig Latin version of \"knowledge\". \"Etherlandsnay\" is the Pig Latin version of \"other lands\". \"Ondhay\" is the Pig Latin version of \"and\". \"Ethay\" is the Pig Latin version of \"the\". \"Istoryhay\" is the", "\"He said that the company has an effective way of communicating, a strong and growing business, and a diverse group of people, and he wants to work there.\"\n\nCan you figure out what the Pig Latin version of this sentence is saying?", "________________________________________________", "\n\nAnswer: \"work day readers develop day is an ongoing process.\"", "\n\n\"the author suggested in the article that the ambiguous possibility of the operation should be considered, but the editor rejected it.\"\n\nPlease solve the problem in English.\n\nAnswer: The author suggested in the article that the ambiguous possibility of the operation should be considered, but the editor rejected it.\n\n\"athay ourhay ebay orfay ypothesishay atthay imetay\" = \"the author suggested in the article\"\n\"ebay ouldshay ashay ehay ethay uggestedsay anyhay erehay ambiguoushay ouldshay opehay ossiblepay\" = \"that the ambiguous possibility of the operation should be considered\"\n\"obabilitypray amesay ethay ashay educingray\" = \"but the editor rejected it\"", "________________.\n\nNote: Please be sure to include spaces between words in the English translation.", "\"Article on 3D printing and its impact on contents creation for really old films.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\nAnswer: \"Overall, opportunities, regional orientation, and national advocacy encompass better effectiveness, intelligent advice, and advisable employment.\"", "\n\nAnswer: \"In the event of an attack, Facebook's security team is adding anticipation and, along with other features, the ability to hide.\"", "\"I am not able to make it to the meeting today because I have a headache and it's not necessary for me to be there.\"\n\nPig Latin: \"anhay ahay orfay ositionpay emakeray ithay akesmay earchsay ecessarynay ashay ofhay overreactionhay aysway ossiblepay itshay ustjay alaysiamay otay otspothay.\"\nEnglish: \"I am not able to make it to the meeting today because I have a headache and it's not necessary for me to be there.\"\n\nPig Latin: \"Iway amway otay ableway otway eekay ittay oway tay otay eetingway oday ecauseway Iway haveway eadacheay andway it'sway otway essarynay forway meway toway beway erehay", "_______________\n\nAnswer: Instead of andedbray (bread) if different day our market, in the elizebay (Elizabeth) area share are all here power differently.\n\nThis is how you would say \"Instead of bread if different day our market, in the Elizabeth area share are all here power differently\" in Pig Latin.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how to convert the sentence to Pig Latin:\n\n* Instead - insteaddhay\n* of - ofhay\n* and - andedbray (bread)\n* different - differntday\n* day - dayhay\n* our - ouryay\n* market - arketmay\n* in - inhay\n* the - ethay\n* Elizabeth - elizebay\n* area - areashay\n* share - arehay\n* are - arehay\n* all - allh", "", "\n\nAnswer: \"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"", "\"the fact that he is my ancestor in no way diminishes my pride.\"\n\nNote: There is a chance that the sentence in Pig Latin is not grammatically correct.

Then -ay is added to the end of each word. The word \"it's\" is an exception, since it starts with a vowel sound and therefore the -hay is added to the end without moving any consonants.

For example, \"and\" becomes \"andhay,\" \"that\" becomes \"thay,\" \"the\" becomes \"eay,\" and so on. To convert the sentence from Pig Latin to English, we simply reverse the process, moving the consonant clusters back to the beginning of the words and removing the -ay ending.
