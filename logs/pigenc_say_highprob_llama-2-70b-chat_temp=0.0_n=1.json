If the word starts with a vowel, -say is added to the end instead.\n\nLet's start by applying these rules to the first word of the sentence: \"at.\" The first consonant cluster of \"at\" is \"t,\" so we move it to the end of the word and add -ay to get \"tay.\"\n\nNext, we can apply the rules to the second word: \"the.\" The", "________________\n\nAnswer: In Pig Latin, the word \"football\" would become \"ootballfay\" (since the first consonant cluster \"ft\" is moved to the end of the word). The word \"didn't\" would become \"idn'tray\" (since the first consonant cluster \"di\" is moved to the end of the word). The word \"proportion\" would become \"otionproportionay\" (since the first consonant cluster \"pr\" is moved to the end of the word). Therefore, the entire sentence would become:\n\n\"Ootballfay idn'tray oisay itionproportionay hayasay otday.\"\n\nThis is the Pig Latin translation of the sentence \"football didn't have the proportion it has today.\"", "\"i-way ope-hay it-hay appens-ay oon-say os-sip-say.\"\n\nNow you are given a sentence in Pig Latin, which you must translate into English.\n\nPig Latin: \"ethay ilday ams-say oop-say ay-way oot-nay.\"\n\nWhat is the sentence in English?\n\nAnswer: \"the child's play thing is broken.\"\n\nNow, if you know what \"sway\" means in Pig Latin, you can use it to translate the following sentence:\n\nPig Latin: \"sway ilday eet-say ay-way ood-say.\"\n\nWhat is the sentence in English?\n\nAnswer: \"the child's food is good.\"\n\nIf you want to learn more about Pig Latin, you can check out the Wikipedia page on it, which", "_____________.", "________________________________", "________________________________.", "____________________________________________________________.\n\nAnswer: English: \"to operate in this environment, some organizations work through their home offices abroad, managing many key processes from there rather than from azerbaijan.\"\nPig Latin: \"o-tray o-per-ate-ay in-thay is-en-timent-ay, ome-say o-rgan-i-zations-way or-kay eth-through-ay their-ay o-me-off-ice-es-ay broad-way, man-aging-ay e-many-key-ay o-cess-es-ay f-rom-there-ay rather-ay than-f-rom-Azerbaijan-ay.\"\n\nNote that this is not a real language and is used more as a game or a code than a way of serious communication.
