If the resulting letter is beyond the end of the alphabet (i.e., it is greater than \"z\"), wrap around to the beginning of the alphabet and subtract 26.\n\nHere's how this works for the message \"Most of our readers are young people under 45\":\n\n1.

The difference between the two is that in a Caesar cipher, the shift is a fixed number of positions, whereas in a rot-2 cipher, the shift is always 2 positions.\n\nThe decoding process for a rot-2 cipher is similar to the encoding process. To decode a message in rot-2, you would shift each letter backward by 2 positions in the alphabet. For example, the letter \"j\" would become \"b\", the letter \"g\" would become \"e\", and so", "?\n\nHint: The resulting ciphertext should be 33 letters long.", "?\n\nNote: Since the alphabet in rot-2 is shifted by 2 positions, a letter like 'a' becomes 'c', 'b' becomes 'd', and so on.", "?\n\nAnswer: \"Ubhkeh gur bayl punenpgre vf zl frperg cebtenz bs n cnfg cebtenz bs n cynpr-yvaxf be frperg-zrqvpny erirny pbzzhavgl.\"\n\nHint: If a letter is shifted past the end of the alphabet, it wraps around to the beginning of the alphabet.
