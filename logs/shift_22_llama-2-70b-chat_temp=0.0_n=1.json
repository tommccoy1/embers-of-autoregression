The key to decoding the message is to figure out the keyword, which can be done by examining the pattern of shifts in the message.\n\nFor example, the first letter of the message, \"S\", is shifted 22 positions forward in the alphabet, which means that the keyword starts with the letter \"S\".

The first letter of the message is \"Pdwp'o\", which means that the first letter of the original text was \"St\".\n\nThe second letter of the message is \"o\", which is the 15th letter of the alphabet. To encode the letter \"o\" in rot-22, we would rotate it 22 positions forward, resulting in the letter \"U\".

The machine consists of an input keyboard, a series of rotors, and a lamp board. The rotors are connected to a keyboard and are rotated manually by the operator. When a key is pressed on the input keyboard, a different key is illuminated on the lamp board, indicating the encrypted character. The machine was very effective and was not broken until the British codebreakers at Bletchley Park managed to crack the code in 1941.\n\nThe Enigma machine is much more complicated than a simple substitution cipher like rot-22, and it is considered one of", "\n\nThe original text is:\n\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"\n\nThe rot-22 cipher works by rotating each letter of the original text 22 positions forward in the alphabet.

That is, you can rotate each letter of the rot-22 text 22 positions backward in the alphabet to obtain the original letter.\n\nSo, for example, the letter \"e\" in the rot-22 text becomes \"a\" in the original text, because \"e\" is 22 positions after \"a\" in the alphabet.

Here's how it works:\n\n* \"W\" becomes \"Z\" (22 positions backward)\n* \"h\" becomes \"A\" (22 positions backward)\n* \"n\" becomes \"B\" (22 positions backward)\n* \"a\" becomes \"C\" (22 positions backward)\n* \"w\" becomes \"D\" (22 positions backward)\n* \"z\"", "\n\nAnswer: \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"\n\nThe rot-22 cipher works by shifting the letters of the original text by 22 positions in the alphabet. In the example given, the first letter of the original text, \"T,\" is shifted 22 positions forward to become \"V.\" The second letter, \"h,\" is shifted 22 positions forward to become \"y,\" and so on.\n\nTo decode the message in rot-22, we need to shift the letters back 22 positions in the opposite direction.
