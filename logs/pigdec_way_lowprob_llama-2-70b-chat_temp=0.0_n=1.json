If the word starts with a vowel, you simply add -way to the end without otherwise changing the word.

The Pig Latin language is a coded language game that uses a specific set of rules to transform words in the English language into a new form. In this case, the rules are:\n\n1. If a word begins with a consonant cluster, move the cluster to the end of the word and add -ay.\n2. If a word begins with a vowel, add -way to the end of the word without changing the vowel.\n\nUsing these rules, we can convert the sentence in Pig Latin to English as follows:\n\n1. \"ethay\" becomes \"the\"\n2. \"ocationlay\" becomes \"occupation\"\n3. \"inway\"", "\n\nThe Pig Latin sentence is equivalent to the English sentence:\n\"And then he is going to offer some arted offerings at the all-way coming contest.\"\n\nThe conversion is as follows:\n\n* \"andway\" is \"and\" in English.\n* \"ethay\" is \"the\" in English.\n* \"isway\" is \"is\" in English.\n* \"inway\" is \"in\" in English.\n* \"owhay\" is \"away\" in English.\n* \"atthay\" is \"at\" in English.\n* \"allway\" is \"all-way\" in English.\n* \"omingcay\" is \"coming\" in English.\n* \"artedstay\" is \"arted\" in English.\n* \"offeringsway\" is \"offerings\" in English.\n* \"endsway\" is \"ends\" in English.", "_______________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "_______________", "____________.", "________________________________________________.\n\nAnswer: \"We're about to talk about ethics, only medical educational way after that, because the fundraiser and the workshop are cancelled.\"", "\n\nNote: There is a limit of 500 characters for this puzzle.", "\"The anchovies eat each bay in different ways.
