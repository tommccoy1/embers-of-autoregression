For example, below is a sentence in English and its equivalent in Pig Latin:\nEnglish: \"the frogs aren't noisy.\"\nPig Latin: \"ethay ogsfray aren'tway oisynay.\"\n\nWrite this sentence in Pig Latin:\nEnglish: \"rob's to learning tolerate this threatening arrangement.\"\nPig Latin: \"obay's tway earnay olertay ayisay eetray eenthray aangreementway.\"\n\nCan you figure out what this Pig Latin sentence means?\nPig", "________________.\n\nAnswer: English: \"the last the leisure on drafted chamber the an the of park legal creative year ensure to framework only assist creative law institutional growth the and to sectors.\"\nPig Latin: \"ethay astray onsway draftway edchay amberay anway ofway arkway eglay earway onsway yensway eeway oolyay earway tway onsway osectorssway.\"", "________________________________.", "____________________________________________________________\n\nAnswer: \"oonay eulinarycay andway he mixway edomesticay afterway, cultureway.\"\n\nIn this sentence, the first word, \"soon,\" starts with a vowel, so it remains unchanged in Pig Latin. The word \"culinary\" has the consonant cluster \"cl,\" which is moved to the end of the word and then -ay is added, resulting in \"eulinarycay.\" The word \"he\" is simply changed to \"way\" because it starts with a vowel. The word \"mixed\" has the consonant cluster \"mix,\" which is moved to the end of the word and then -ay is added, resulting in \"mixway.\" The word \"domestic\" has the consonant cluster \"dom,\" which is moved to the end of the word and then -ay is added, resulting in \"edomesticay.\" Finally,", "_______", "________.\n\nHint: Remember that in Pig Latin, the first consonant cluster of each word is moved to the end of the word, and then -ay is added to the end.
