The ninth word is \"are\"\n * a -> s\n * r -> t\n * e -> r\n So \"are\" becomes \"str\"\n\n10. The tenth word is \"located\"\n * l -> a\n * o -> p\n * c -> v\n * a -> s\n * t -> y\n * e -> r\n * d -> f\n So \"located\" becomes \"apvsyrf\"\n\n11. The eleventh word is \"in\"\n * i -> o\n * n -> m\n So \"in\" becomes \"om\"\n\n12. The twelfth word is \"Russia\"\n * R -> T\n * u -> i\n * s -> d\n * s -> d\n * i -> o\n * a -> s\n So \"Russia\" becomes \"Tidddos\"\n\n13.
