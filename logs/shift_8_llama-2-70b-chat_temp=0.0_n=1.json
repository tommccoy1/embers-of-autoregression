To decrypt the message, you can shift each letter back by 8 positions in the alphabet.\n\nTo decrypt the message \"Jcb bpqa bqum, bpmzm uig itaw jm ivwbpmz zmiawv\", we can start by shifting each letter back by 8 positions in the alphabet:\n\nJ -> K\nC -> D\nB -> E\nP -> F\nQ -> G\nA -> H\nB -> I\nM -> L\nZ -> K", "\n\nAnswer: \"Meet me at the park, we will have a picnic there.\"\n\nTo decode the message, we need to shift each letter 8 positions backward in the alphabet.

Here's how the letters in the rot-8 text correspond to the original letters:\n\nA \u2192 Z\nE \u2192 Y\nM \u2192 X\nT \u2192 W\nT \u2192 V\nQ \u2192 U\nB \u2192 T\nF \u2192 S\nI \u2192 R\nK \u2192 Q\nB \u2192 P\nT \u2192 O\nG \u2192 N\n\nUsing this substitution, you can decode the message to get the original text:\n\nEmtt, qb eia vwb mfikbtg xtivvml nzwu bpm jmoqvvqvo.\nTom, can you move the car to the side street?\n\nNote that the rot-8 cipher is a simple substitution cipher and can be broken easily", "?\n\nAnswer: \"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.\"\n\nNote: The first letter of the first word of the original text is capitalized.", "?\n\nI would appreciate it if you could explain how you decoded this message.", "\n\nAnswer: \"I am the one who knocks. You will see me soon. I am watching you.\"\n\nThis problem is an example of a Caesar Cipher, which is a simple encryption technique that replaces each letter in the original message with a letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. In this case, the key is 8, which means that each letter in the original message is replaced by the letter that is 8 positions down the alphabet.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to reverse the process by moving each letter in the rot-8 text back up the alphabet by 8 positions to get the original letter. Here is the solution:\n\nRot-8 text: \"Uwab wn wcz zmilmza izm gwcvo xmwxtm cvlmz 45.\"\nOriginal text: \"I am the one who knocks. You will see me soon. I am watching", "?\n\nAnswer: The original text is \"I want to play a game with you.

Shift each letter in the rot-8 message by 8 positions backward in the alphabet.\n2. Replace each letter with the corresponding letter that is 8 positions before it in the alphabet.\n3. The resulting message should be in English.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. \"J\" becomes \"I\" (8 positions before \"J\")\n2. \"M\" becomes \"K\" (8 positions before \"M\")\n3. \"K\" becomes \"L\" (8 positions before \"K\")", "_______________________________\n\nAnswer: The decoded message reads: \"Meet me at the park tomorrow at 2pm; come alone.\"", "\n\nAnswer: \"Let's meet at the park, it's a beautiful day.\"\n\nTo decode the message, first shift each letter 8 positions backward in the alphabet. This will reveal the original text:\n\nPwxmncttg -> Let's\nWcz ewzs qa -> Meet\nVwb innmkbml -> At\nJg xwtqbqka -> The\nWz zmtqoqwv -> Park\n\nSo, the original text is \"Let's meet at the park, it's a beautiful day.\"", "\n\nAnswer: \"I want to go home.\"\n\nThe message in rot-8 is \"Q bpqvs bpmzm izm i twb wn owwl eiga bw jzqvo kpivom\"\nThe message in English is \"I want to go home\"\n\nRot-8 is a simple cipher that replaces each letter with the letter that is 8 positions ahead of it in the alphabet. To decrypt the message, we can apply the reverse operation, replacing each letter with the letter that is 8 positions before it in the alphabet.\n\nHere's how the decryption process would look for the given message:\n\nQ -> H (8 positions before Q)\nB -> G (8 positions before B)\nP -> F (8 positions before P)\nQ -> E (8 positions before Q)\nV -> D (8 positions before V)\nS -> C (8", "?\n\nAnswer: Stay calm.", "_______________________________\n\nTo decode this message, you'll need to reverse the process of rot-8, which means you have to shift each letter backward in the alphabet by 8 positions.

In this case, the message is encoded using a substitution cipher, which replaces each letter with a different letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. To solve this problem, you will need to figure out the key (the number of positions to shift the letters) and then use the substitution cipher to decode the message.\n\nOne approach to solving this problem is to look for common letters or patterns in the encoded message that might give clues about the key. Another approach is to use frequency analysis, which involves counting the number of times each letter appears in the encoded message and comparing it to the expected frequency of letters in the original language.

It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle.

In this case, each letter is shifted 8 positions forward in the alphabet, so \"a\" becomes \"h\", \"b\" becomes \"i\", and so on.\n\nTo decode the message, you can use the same algorithm, shifting each letter back 8 positions up the alphabet.

Replace each letter with the corresponding letter 8 positions before it in the alphabet.\n\nSo, for example, the letter \"a\" becomes \"h\" (8 positions before it in the alphabet), \"b\" becomes \"g\" (7 positions before it in the alphabet), \"c\" becomes \"f\" (6 positions before it in the alphabet), and so on.\n\nUsing this method, we can decode the message \"Bpm ackkmaa wn kw-uiviomumvb kiv jm kzmlqbml bw qba ijqtqbg", "\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe original text of the given Rot-8 message is:\n\n\"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.

The original text of the given Rot-8 message is:\n\n\"I love to eat pizza with extra cheese and pepperoni. You can never have too much pizza.\"\n\nHere's how the Rot-8 cipher works:\n\n1. \"Bw\" corresponds to \"I love\" (since B = 8th letter of the alphabet, and W = 23rd letter).\n2. \"eqbplzie\" corresponds to \"eat pizza\" (since E = 5th letter, Q = 17th letter, B = 8th letter, P = 16th letter, L = 12th letter, I = 9th letter, E = 5th letter).\n3. \"uwvmg\" corresponds to", "\n\nAnswer: \"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.

This means that 'a' becomes 'i', 'b' becomes 'j', 'c' becomes 'k', and so on.\n\nTo decode the message, we need to shift each letter backward by 8 positions in the alphabet. Here's how the decoded message looks:\n\nItzmilg, bpmzm izm aqova bpib Bczsa, nzwu itt eitsa wn t", "\"What do you think about this new plan? It seems like it might be more effective than the old one.\"\n\nRot-8 is a very simple cipher, and it can be easily cracked using frequency analysis. In this case, the most common letter in the cipher text is 'p', which is likely to be the most common letter in the original text as well. If we assume that the most common letter in the original text is 'e', then we can substitute 'p' for 'e' in the cipher text and see if it makes sense. Sure enough, this works, and we can decode the message as follows:\n\nRot-8 text: \"Pmzm ib Otwjit Dwqkma, epqkp xcjtqapma umlqi ivl abwzgbmttqvo nzwu bpm otwjit uirwzqbg, uivg wn", "\n\n(15 points) \n\nAnswer:\nThe original text is: \"Mike and Bob will be at the beach with their wives from 2 to 4 pm. They will have a picnic and play some games. They will also bring their kids and some beverages.\"\n\nExplanation:\nTo decode the rot-8 message, we need to shift each letter 8 positions backward in the alphabet. Here is the decoded message:\n\nMqopb wn bpm bwx bmv pqopmab uwcvbiqv xmisa qv bpm ewztl izm twkibml qv Vmxit, uisqvo qb i xwxctiz lmabqvibqwv nwz uwcvbiqvmmza.\n\nMike and Bob will be at the beach with their wives from 2", "\"I can't stay here. I have to go to the store. I need to buy some milk.\"\n\nAnswer: The original text is \"I can't stay here. I have to go to the store. I need to buy some milk.\"\n\nRot-8 is a simple substitution cipher that replaces each letter with the letter that is 8 positions ahead of it in the alphabet. To decode a message in rot-8, we can use the same process, but in reverse. That is, we substitute each letter in the message with the letter that is 8 positions before it in the alphabet.\n\nHere's how the decoding process works for the message \"Bpm awczkma bpm vmeaxixmz kqbml ixxmizml bw zmtg wv kwvrmkbczm ivl zcuwcz\":\n\n1. \"Bpm\" becomes \"I can\"", "\n\nAnswer: The message in rot-8 is \"Awum wn bpm uiviomza wn bpwam wzoivqhibqwva pil bw tmidm bpm kwcvbzg inbmzeizla.\"\n\nThe decoded message is \"I want to go to the beach and relax in the sun.\"", "\n\nHint: You can use the same algorithm to decode the message as you would to encode a message.", "\n\nAnswer: \"I can't make out what you're saying.

To decode it, we need to reverse the process by shifting each letter back 8 positions in the alphabet.
