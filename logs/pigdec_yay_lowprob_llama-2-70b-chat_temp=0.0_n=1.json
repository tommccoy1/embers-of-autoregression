To do this, you need to apply the rules of Pig Latin to the sentence. For example, in Pig Latin, the first consonant cluster of each word is moved to the end of the word, and then -ay is added to the end of the word. If the word starts with a vowel, then -yay is added to the end of the word instead.\n\nTo convert the sentence from Pig Latin to English, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Move the first consonant cluster of each word to the end of the word.\n2. Add -ay to the end of each word.\n3. If the word starts with a vowel, add -yay to the end of the word instead", "________________.\n\nHint: You can use the following rules to help you convert the sentence:\n\n* If the word starts with a vowel, simply add -yay to the end without changing the word.\n* If the word starts with a consonant, move the first consonant cluster to the end of the word and add -ay.\n\nPlease fill in the blank with the English translation of the Pig Latin sentence.", "\n\nAnswer: \"I'm not comfortable, it's too hot and humid, I'm going to stay inside.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. \"Orfay\" becomes \"for\" in English.\n2. \"Ooklay\" becomes \"ook\" (meaning \"book\") in English.\n3. \"I'myay\" becomes \"I'm\" in English.\n4. \"Orfay\" becomes \"for\" in English.\n5. \"Aitstray\" becomes \"state\" in English.\n6. \"Oningray\" becomes \"on\" in English.\n7. \"Iyay\" becomes \"I\" in English.\n8. \"astpay\" becomes \"stay\" in English.\n\nTherefore, the English translation of the Pig Latin sentence is: \"I'm not comfortable, it's too hot and humid, I'", "________________________________________________________________\n\nAnswer: \"And that's how they're able to make a living by working hard every day, despite the fact that they don't have much formal education.\"\n\nThis is a Pig Latin sentence: \"waytay amtay okeay ayay amway\"\n\nWhat does it translate to in English?\n\nAnswer: \"What time is it now?\"", "_______________________________________________\n\n\n\n\n"], "accs": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "acc": 0.0, "eds": [40, 51, 69, 35, 606, 269, 62, 60, 64, 621, 323, 112, 566, 59, 684, 512, 54, 83, 157, 81, 569, 222, 440, 169, 171, 76, 570, 68, 57, 183, 489, 151, 110, 128, 140, 87, 44, 68, 407, 442, 173, 168, 597, 3185, 83, 107, 385, 89, 436, 145, 330, 84, 246, 47, 86, 131, 595, 156, 124, 161, 45, 310, 131, 43, 118, 309, 62, 179, 113, 524, 199, 68, 122, 458, 112, 111, 111, 118, 145, 670, 60, 56, 141, 118, 526, 71, 561, 97, 471, 96, 213, 92, 142, 62, 244, 683, 336, 488, 274, 65], "ed": 251.71}
