Rot-13 is a substitution cipher in which each letter is shifted 13 positions forward in the alphabet. To decode this message, we need to shift each letter back by 13 positions in the alphabet.\n2.

The resulting message, \"Fgnl urer!\", can be decoded by reversing the process, that is, by shifting each letter back 13 positions in the alphabet.\n\nThe second message is more complex. It is written in a way that each letter is shifted 13 positions forward in the alphabet, but some letters are also replaced with other letters based on their positions in the alphabet.

The rot-13 text is then decoded by shifting each letter 13 positions backward in the alphabet, so for example the letter \"n\" becomes \"a\", \"o\" becomes \"b\", and so on.\n\nThe rot-13 cipher is a simple example of a substitution cipher, where each letter in the original text is replaced by a letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
