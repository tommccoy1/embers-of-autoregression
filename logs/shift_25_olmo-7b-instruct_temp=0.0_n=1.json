Next, we need to find the position of each letter in the shifted alphabet. To do this, we can use a table or look up the positions of each letter in the shifted alphabet.\n\nFor example, the position of the letter \"H\" in the original alphabet is 1, so in the shifted alphabet, it would be 25.

First, we need to identify the alphabet used in the cipher. In this case, it appears to be the standard English alphabet.\n\n2. Next, we can see that each letter has been shifted 25 positions forward in the alphabet. For example, \"R\" is now \"V\", \"S\" is now \"Z\", and so on.\n\n3. To decode the message, we can simply read the alphabet in reverse order (from \"Z\" to \"A\") and translate each letter", "The given message in Rot-25 is:\n\n\"Lnrs ne ntq qdzcdqr, itcfhmf ax sgd rszshrshbr, zqd knbzsdc hm Qtrrhz zmc Szihjhrszm, enkknvdc ax sgd TRZ, Dtqnod zmc nsgdq bntmsqhdr.\"\n\nTo decode this message in Rot-25, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Shift each letter by 25 positions to the right in the alphabet.\n2. Convert the shifted letters to their corresponding English words.\n\nHere's the process:\n\n1. Shift each letter:\n   - R -> S\n   - S -> T\n   - T -> U\n   - U -> V\n   - V -> W\n   - W -> X\n   - X -> Y\n   - Y -> Z\n   - Z -> A\n"], "accs": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "acc": 0.0, "eds": [545, 672, 562, 656, 720, 446, 531, 608, 469, 653, 629, 472, 704, 769, 620, 370, 557, 466, 637, 562, 646, 690, 486, 566, 549, 659, 447, 712, 457, 449, 490, 486, 467, 550, 435, 638, 618, 438, 640, 524, 417, 410, 475, 442, 665, 478, 577, 544, 573, 497, 417, 651, 450, 689, 547, 608, 331, 423, 480, 440, 541, 628, 410, 418, 396, 441, 578, 604, 654, 631, 444, 530, 527, 430, 537, 359, 496, 423, 378, 485, 437, 489, 625, 561, 631, 474, 614, 435, 585, 689, 557, 188, 514, 461, 442, 674, 620, 522, 527, 444], "ed": 531.08}
