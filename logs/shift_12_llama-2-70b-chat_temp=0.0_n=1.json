In a Vigenere cipher, each letter is shifted by a different number of positions, depending on the key. In this case, the key is \"uz tue huqi\" and the shift for each letter is given by the corresponding letter of the key. For example, the first letter of the message \"u\" is shifted by 20 positions (the position of \"u\" in the key), so it becomes \"z\".

First, the message is written in upper case letters.\n2. Then, each letter is shifted 12 positions forward in the alphabet. If the letter is at the end of the alphabet (i.e., Z), it is wrapped around to the beginning of the alphabet (i.e., A).\n3. Finally, the shifted letters are arranged in the correct order to form the ciphertext (i.e., the encrypted message).\n\nFor example, the letter \"A\" becomes \"L\" (12 positions forward), \"B\" becomes \"M\" (12 positions forward), \"C\" becomes \"N\" (12 positions forward), and so on.\n\nHere is a table that shows how the letters are shifted in rot-12:\n\n| Letter |", "\n\nThis problem is an example of a Caesar Cipher, which is a simple encryption technique that replaces each letter in the original message with a letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. In this case, the key is 12, which means that each letter is replaced by the letter 12 positions down the alphabet.\n\nTo solve the problem, you can use the same algorithm as the encryption algorithm. That is, for each letter in the rot-12 text, you can shift it back up the alphabet by 12 positions to get the original letter. Here's how the decoding process would work for the given message:\n\n1. \"F\" becomes \"E\" (12 positions down from \"F\")\n2. \"t\" becomes \"t\" (since \"t\" is already 12 positions down from \"F\")\n3. \"q\" becomes \"q\" (since \"q\" is already", "________________________________\n\nAnswer: \"I am your friend in the secret police, do not come to the meeting tonight.

However, we can use the same method to decode it as we did for the first message.\n\nFirst, we need to shift each letter 12 positions forward in the alphabet to decode the message. This can be done by using the following steps:\n\n1. Write out the alphabet above the rot-12 text, with the first letter of the alphabet at the top.\n2. Under each letter of the rot-12 text, write the letter that is 12 positions ahead of it in the alphabet.\n3.

The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique that shifts each letter by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.
