For example, the letter \"N\" becomes \"L\", the letter \"g\" becomes \"r\", and so on.\n\nIf you are unsure how to decrypt the message, you can try using an online rot-13 decoder tool or a cryptography app that supports rot-13.

Since there are 26 letters in the alphabet, this means that each letter is replaced by the letter that comes after it in the alphabet, wrapping around to the beginning of the alphabet when necessary. For example, the letter \"a\" becomes \"n\", \"b\" becomes \"o\", and so on.\n\nTo decrypt a message in rot-13, you can use the same process, substituting each letter with the letter that comes before it in the alphabet. So, for example, the letter \"n\" becomes \"a\",", "?\n\nAnswer: \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"\n\nHint: The rot-13 algorithm works by shifting each letter forward 13 positions in the alphabet, so \"a\" becomes \"n\", \"b\" becomes \"o\", and so on.
