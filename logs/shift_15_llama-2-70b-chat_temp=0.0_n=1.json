Substitute each letter with a different letter that is 15 positions ahead of it in the alphabet. For example, 'a' becomes 'o', 'b' becomes 'p', 'c' becomes 'q', and so on.\n3.

The first letter of the rot-15 text, \"I\", corresponds to the 15th letter of the alphabet, \"O\".\n2. The second letter, \"w\", corresponds to the 15th letter after \"w\", which is \"h\".\n3.

For example, the first letter in the rot-15 text is \"i\", which is the 9th letter of the alphabet. Subtracting 15 from 9 gives us 4, which corresponds to the letter \"d\".\n\nHere is a step-by-step decoding of the message:\n\n1. \"Iwt\" becomes \"dwt\" (since i-15 = d)\n2. \"Gthdajixdc\" becomes \"thedajixdc\" (since g-15 = t, h-15 = h, d-15 = d, a-15 = a, j-15 = j, i-15 = i, x-15 = x, d-15 = d, c-15 = c", "?\n\nI found the solution to the rot-15 cipher by using a letter-substitution method.

Here is one way to approach it:\n\n1. First, notice that the message is written in a particular pattern, where each letter is shifted 15 positions forward in the alphabet. This means that every letter in the message can be replaced by the letter that is 15 positions before it in the alphabet. For example, the letter \"a\" becomes \"o\", \"b\" becomes \"p\", and so on.\n2. Next, notice that the message contains a number of recognizable words and phrases. For example, the word \"Txvwi\" is likely to be a misspelling of the word \"Texas\", and the phrase \"ide itc\" is likely to be a misspelling of the phrase \"Idea Tech\".\n3. Using these two pieces of information, it is possible to begin", "\"I will meet you at the park tomorrow at 3:00.\"\n\nYou can use the Rot-15 cipher to decode the message. To decode, shift each letter in the rot-15 text back 15 positions in the alphabet. In other words, instead of shifting forward 15 positions as in encryption, you shift back 15 positions to get the original letter.\n\nSo, the first letter in the rot-15 text, \"I\", would become the letter \"H\" in the original text, since \"H\" is 15 positions before \"I\" in the alphabet. The second letter in the rot-15 text, \"w\", would become the letter \"E\", since \"E\" is 15 positions before \"w\" in the alphabet.
