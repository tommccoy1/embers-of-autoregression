The thirteenth word is \"struggle\"\n * s -> d\n * t -> y\n * r -> t\n * u -> i\n * g -> t\n * g -> t\n * l -> a\n * e -> r\n So \"struggle\" becomes \"dytiitlar\"\n14. The fourteenth word is \"with\"\n * w -> e\n * i -> u\n * t -> y\n * h -> j\n So \"with\" becomes \"euyj\"\n15. The fifteenth word is \"insufficient\"\n * i -> u\n * n -> b\n * s -> d\n * u -> i\n * f -> r\n * f -> r\n * i -> u\n * c -> v\n * i -> u\n * e -> r\n * n -> b\n * t -> y\n So \"insufficient\" becomes \"ubdirruverby\"\n16. The sixteenth word is \"funding.\"\n * f -> r\n * u -> i\n * n -> b\n * d -> f\n * i -> u\n * n -> b\n * g -> t\n * . -> .\n So \"funding.\" becomes \"ribubtg.\"\n\nTherefore, the message in the keyboard cipher is: \"Yjr tdopbdunauyu rptdty otyrvyupob esd frastryerf yp yjr trtupbds, ejuvj prtyrb dytiitlar euyj ubdirruverby ribubtg.\"\n\nKeyboard cipher: \"Yjr tdopbdunauyu rptdty otyrvyupob esd frastryerf yp yjr trtupbds, ejuvj prtyrb dytiitlar euyj ubdirruverby ribubtg.\"", "Encoded message: \"Npdt ig pdr tfeewt, kyuhofr cn yjr dyujsyfkd, sduhqg ed wkh YDI, Rtyuwi dqg rujhw frxuvb.\" \nKeyboard cipher: Npdt ig pdr tfeewt, kyuhofr cn yjr dyujsyfkd, sduhqg ed wkh YDI, Rtyuwi dqg rujhw frxuvb."], "accs": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "acc": 0.0, "eds": [1148, 1182, 1187, 1526, 993, 1135, 1515, 932, 1098, 1395, 2030, 1353, 1312, 1243, 1374, 1096, 1995, 1594, 1559, 1816, 1472, 1767, 1449, 1701, 1530, 1480, 238, 1149, 2554, 3892, 1833, 243, 2221, 133, 2682, 140, 1842, 246, 2008, 1367, 3204, 3260, 1627, 2813, 796, 2186, 2016, 1824, 2279, 1425, 209, 1734, 222, 1346, 145, 1873, 5907, 2946, 2285, 3030, 1542, 1333, 1981, 260, 4946, 2520, 1148, 2047, 1562, 1603, 2677, 216, 198, 257, 1504, 3690, 1882, 3814, 4277, 1516, 4500, 2264, 5972, 2158, 1662, 2047, 300, 3282, 1514, 1067, 1270, 343, 5563, 271, 5950, 1602, 1724, 2049, 2374, 161], "ed": 1836.03}
