It works by shifting each letter of the original text by 13 positions in the alphabet. For example, the first letter of the original text, \"T\", becomes the 13th letter of the alphabet, \"M\", in the rot-13 text. The second letter, \"E\", becomes the 13th letter after that, \"N\", and so on.\n\nTo decode a message written in rot-13, you simply shift each letter back 13 positions in the opposite direction.

In this case, the cipher is rot-13, which replaces each letter with the letter that is 13 positions after it in the alphabet.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to reverse the process of rot-13. We can do this by replacing each letter in the rot-13 text with the letter that is 13 positions before it in the alphabet.\n\nHere is the solution:\n\nRot-13 text: \"Guvf vf jul V jnagrq gb qrqvpngr vg gb nyy jbzra.\"\n\nDecoded text: \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"\n\nThis is a well-known pangram, a phrase that uses all the letters of", "???\n\nAnswer: The message in rot-13 translates to \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"", "________________________________\n\nNote: In rot-13, the alphabet is shifted 13 positions forward.
