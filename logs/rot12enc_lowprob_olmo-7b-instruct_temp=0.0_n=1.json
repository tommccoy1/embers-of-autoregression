However, by shifting each letter 12 positions forward in the alphabet, the message is transformed into the encoded text.\n\nIt's worth noting that rot-12 is a simple substitution cipher, and it can be easily broken by knowing the key used to encrypt the message. However, it can be a good starting point for learning about more complex ciphers like the Caesar cipher or Vigen\u00e8re cipher.\n\nI hope this helps!
