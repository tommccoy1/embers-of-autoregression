To do this, we can use the following table:\n\n| Original letter | Alphabet shifted 15 positions to the right |\n| --- | --- |\n| A | Z |\n| B | Y |\n| C | X |\n| D | W |\n| E | V |\n| F | U |\n| G |"], "accs": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "acc": 0.0, "eds": [493, 445, 617, 463, 444, 731, 505, 527, 576, 615, 478, 415, 404, 538, 480, 650, 451, 404, 606, 444, 556, 472, 566, 583, 891, 552, 527, 617, 465, 408, 532, 431, 482, 567, 459, 416, 411, 425, 633, 531, 492, 426, 628, 418, 567, 462, 402, 411, 479, 596, 357, 411, 536, 501, 496, 679, 390, 424, 468, 432, 557, 498, 614, 512, 574, 364, 577, 444, 618, 522, 435, 536, 515, 430, 483, 439, 451, 423, 387, 588, 142, 399, 440, 374, 485, 448, 459, 520, 611, 598, 507, 649, 574, 435, 450, 507, 594, 368, 447, 438], "ed": 497.97}
