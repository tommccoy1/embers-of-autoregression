The task is to take a sentence and rewrite it by swapping the words that appear before and after certain articles (namely, \"the,\" \"a,\" and \"an\").\n\nThe resulting sentence will still make sense grammatically, but it will have a different word order, which can be a bit confusing to read at first.

The first occurrence of \"the\" is not swapped, because there is no word following it.
