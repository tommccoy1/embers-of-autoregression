The result, however, is not directly available. We can, however, find the product by multiplying the numbers of 652, which is 6 * 52, and then adding the numbers of 852, which is 8 * 12. This gives us 6 * 52 + 8 * 12 = 6 * 12 * 11 = 652, so 852 * 652 equals 652 * 11 times 852. Therefore, the product is 6", "The mathematical expression in Question 2 is:\n\n407 times 103 = 37,140\n\nTo evaluate this expression, you need to multiply 407 by 103.
