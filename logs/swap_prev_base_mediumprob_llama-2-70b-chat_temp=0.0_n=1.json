You can assume that the input sentence will always be a sentence, and that it will always contain at least one article.\n\nHint: You can use the string.split() method to split the sentence into a list of words, and then iterate over the list to swap the articles.\n\nAnother hint: You can use the if-else statements to check if the current word is an article, and then swap it with the next word in the list.\n\nHere's an example of how your function should work:\n\ndef swap_articles(sentence):\n    # Split the sentence into a list of words\n    words = sentence.split()\n\n    # Iter", "?", "\"Overall, it is advisable to advocate for more regional orientation that encompasses national organizations, closer understanding, and streamlined immigration.\"\n\nIn this case, the output is the same as the input, but the words \"a\" and \"the\" have been swapped.\n\nI hope this helps!

Also, you can only swap each word with the next word in the sentence, and you cannot skip over any words.\n\nYour task is to write a function that takes a sentence as an argument, and returns the modified sentence with the swaps you described.\n\nI've included some example input/output pairs below.

In general, try to avoid creating sentences that are difficult to understand or sound awkward. If you encounter such a case, you can either rearrange the sentence or keep it as is, but please make a note of it in your answer.\n\n(Optional) If you'd like to add some fun to the task, you can also include a few typos or deliberate mistakes in your answer to make it more challenging for the next person to correct.
