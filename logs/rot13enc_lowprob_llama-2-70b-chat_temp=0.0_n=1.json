For example, the letter \"a\" becomes \"n\", \"b\" becomes \"o\", \"c\" becomes \"p\", and so on.\n\nUsing this substitution, we can encode the message \"Among in hunting is areas which of less which disc stores and in the world favour?\" as follows:\n\nA -> N\nM -> O\nO -> P\nG -> R\nI -> E\n", "?\n\nI can't solve this.

The key to the cipher is that the letter that is shifted 13 positions forward in the alphabet is always the same as the letter that is shifted 13 positions backward in the alphabet.\n\nIn the example above, the letter \"a\" is shifted 13 positions forward in the alphabet to become \"n\", and the letter \"n\" is shifted 13 positions backward in the alphabet to become \"a\".
