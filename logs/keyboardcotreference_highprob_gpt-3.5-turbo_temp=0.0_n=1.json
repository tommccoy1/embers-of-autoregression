The sixteenth word is \"funding.\"\n * f -> g\n * u -> i\n * n -> m\n * d -> f\n * i -> o\n * n -> m\n * g -> h\n * . -> .\n So \"funding.\" becomes \"gimfomh.\"\n\nTherefore, the message in the keyboard cipher is: \"Yjr terdopmdokeyu gpt gptdery otpyrvyopm esd fkrhsyrf yp yjr terhopmd, ejojv pgyrm dytihhkr eoyj omdigoovrmy gimfomh.\"\n\nKeyboard cipher: \"Yjr terdopmdokeyu gpt gptdery otpyrvyopm esd fkrhsyrf yp yjr terhopmd, ejojv pgyrm dytihhkr eoyj omdigoovrmy gimfomh.\"", "Encoded message: \"Bpdt ig pif tewwet, kyfjyig fu ymj xyfwjyjw, dufqjifd yt uif VDY, Rtyjwv dqg ymjyht htsluzxjw.\"\n\nKeyboard cipher: Bpdt ig pif tewwet, kyfjyig fu ymj xyfwjyjw, dufqjifd yt uif VDY, Rtyjwv dqg ymjyht htsluzxjw."], "accs": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "acc": 0.0, "eds": [1144, 1201, 1209, 1526, 1000, 1138, 1439, 936, 1102, 1395, 2059, 1365, 1316, 1241, 1382, 1092, 1999, 1605, 1553, 1807, 1485, 1475, 1447, 1626, 1522, 1486, 205, 1150, 2560, 3968, 2123, 234, 2215, 1843, 2687, 1590, 1848, 224, 2002, 1369, 3204, 3047, 1625, 2814, 791, 2181, 2038, 1821, 2299, 1421, 249, 1722, 5940, 1342, 2530, 1896, 208, 208, 2466, 261, 1540, 1328, 1976, 273, 2564, 2522, 1138, 2047, 1571, 1603, 2691, 4465, 244, 221, 1512, 350, 1876, 3834, 4310, 1516, 292, 2263, 1953, 2158, 1672, 2050, 3718, 3268, 1510, 1065, 1273, 406, 234, 4278, 3836, 1601, 1513, 2062, 2364, 172], "ed": 1739.0}
