You can solve it using a variety of techniques, including:\n\n1. Brute Force: One simple way to solve this problem is to try all possible combinations of words and see if the resulting sentence makes sense. However, this approach can be time-consuming and inefficient for large sentences.\n2. Dynamic Programming: Another way to solve this problem is to use dynamic programming. You can create a 2D matrix where the rows represent the words in the original sentence and the columns represent the position of the words in the scrambled sentence. Then, you can fill in the matrix cell by cell, starting from the first word, and recursively applying the rules of word scramb", "\"In just than golf Belize, fishing the is more test.\"\n\nInput 3: \"The more a know about the universe, the more a realize how much more there is to learn.\"\nOutput 3: \"The more I know about the universe, the more I realize how much more there is to learn.\"\n\nInput 4: \"In a little a while, I will a go to the store.\"\nOutput 4: \"In a little while, I will go to the store.\"\n\nInput 5: \"The a man a walked into a bar a with a a giraffe.\"\nOutput 5: \"The man walked into a bar with a giraffe.\"\n\nInput 6: \"When we a got to the a top of the a mountain, we a saw a beautiful a view.\"\nOutput 6: \"When we got to the top of the mountain, we saw a beautiful view.\"\n\n", "\"For years now, high school sports careers 21 teaching children a Brisbane made Sweawan.\"\n\nYour turn!", "\"Sam is the actual right card around finds corner.\"\n\nNote: The sentence may not be grammatically correct.
