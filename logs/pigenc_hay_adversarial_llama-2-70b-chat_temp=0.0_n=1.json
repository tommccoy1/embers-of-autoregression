Write the sentence in Pig Latin.\n\nAnswer: Inway, itthay icksay an ecosystem fay me.", "\n\nAnswer: \"elizay eboostsway ethay orld'sway irstjay amjaray anctuaryay.\"", "?\n\nNote: Please use the same format as the example sentence, i.e. first the English sentence, then its equivalent in Pig Latin.", "", "", "________________.\n\nAnswer: English: \"don\u2019t just be at a standstill and hope you\u2019ll survive filmraking.\"\nPig Latin: \"on'tay eustay ayay nday ayay efilrakinghay.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. First, we move the first consonant cluster of each word to the end of the word.\n2. Then, we add -ay to the end of each word.\n3. If a word starts with a vowel, we simply add -hay to the end without otherwise changing the word.\n\nUsing these rules, we can translate the sentence \"don\u2019t just be at a standstill and hope you\u2019ll survive filmraking\" into Pig Latin as \"on'tay eustay ayay nday ayay efilrakinghay.\""], "accs": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "acc": 0.0, "eds": [105, 70, 96, 53, 34, 84, 130, 45, 78, 39, 76, 95, 93, 90, 112, 103, 97, 121, 127, 148, 552, 44, 72, 411, 146, 191, 83, 97, 81, 183, 248, 216, 195, 196, 80, 129, 69, 163, 474, 63, 79, 199, 208, 94, 374, 56, 136, 106, 94, 63, 208, 397, 41, 67, 148, 42, 170, 214, 199, 63, 95, 109, 161, 104, 146, 74, 75, 140, 307, 62, 51, 3185, 157, 147, 309, 44, 49, 158, 67, 58, 29, 84, 228, 211, 526, 84, 347, 128, 164, 72, 148, 58, 430, 356, 93, 22, 100, 77, 159, 510], "ed": 177.71}
