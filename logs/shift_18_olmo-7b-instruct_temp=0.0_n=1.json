For example, the first letter \"L\" is found at position 3 in the alphabet, so we can find the letter \"L\" in the original text.\n\n3. Once we have found the corresponding letters in the original text, we can shift them 18 positions forward in the alphabet. For example, the letter \"L\" in the original text would become \"M\", and", "The given message in Rot-18 is:\n\nAl ak kladd dacw lzak af s fmetwj gx eafakljawk, fgl bmkl af lzw Eafakljq gx Wvmuslagf.\n\nTo decode this message in Rot-18, we need to shift each letter 18 positions to the right in the alphabet.

Next, we can look up each letter in the Rot-18 alphabet and find its corresponding position in the English alphabet. For example, the letter \"K\" in Rot-18 is shifted 18 positions to the right, so it becomes \"J\" in the English alphabet.\n\n3. Now, we can use this information to decode the message.
