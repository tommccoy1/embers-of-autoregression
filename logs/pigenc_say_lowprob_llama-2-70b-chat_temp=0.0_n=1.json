The translator will then convert it into Pig Latin and display it below the text box. You can also listen to the Pig Latin translation by clicking on the \"Listen\" button.\n\nThe translator is designed to work with short phrases and single words.

For example, below is a sentence in English and its equivalent in Pig Latin:\nEnglish: \"the frogs aren't noisy.\"\nPig Latin: \"ethay ogsfray aren'tsay oisynay.\"\n\nWrite this sentence in Pig Latin:\nEnglish: \"an a for position remake it makes search necessary as of overreaction ways possible its just malaysia to hotspot.\"\nPig Latin: \"a-nay eftay orfay o-sition-ay ekmay etay ear-sway e-th", "\n\nAnswer: Instead-way, of-fay branded-ay harvested-ay different-ay local-ay your-ay market-way, in-way the-way belize-way areas-way are-way all-fay per-way power-fay differently-fay.\n\nNote that this is a more complex example of Pig Latin, and the rules for forming words in Pig Latin are applied consistently throughout the sentence. ", "?", "?", "________________.\n\nAnswer: English: \"the that and me hopes made had i the simplicity my ancestors woman decent am today.\"\nPig Latin: \"ehtay atsanday opehsay adehaday iway ehtay ecnatsay eeday amway otay oday.\"", "____________\n\nThis is a good exercise for developing your understanding of how words are constructed from smaller units such as sounds and letters, as well as your ability to think creatively and apply rules in a new context.\n\nHINT: To speak Pig Latin, you must move the first consonant cluster of each word to the end of the word, and then add -ay. If the word starts with a vowel, you simply add -say.\n\nANSWER: \"at populations about and time, the agricultural digitisation same very the advanced supportive kyrgyz are innovations\"\n\nPig Latin: \"at-way o-population-say about-way and-time-say, thee-agricultural-digitisation-say ame-very-say thee-advanced-say support-ive-say kyrgyz-say are-innovations-say\"\n\nHow's that?", "____________.\n\n(Note: Please use the same format as the example, i.e. a sentence in English followed by its equivalent in Pig Latin.)\n\nAnswer:\nEnglish: \"progress it the didn't guarantees hold may allow.\"\nPig Latin: \"ogresspay itthay eedn'tay guaranteehay oldway alway alloway.\"", "?\n\nAnswer: English: \"i as hope as well it settles observed.\"\nPig Latin: \"i-say ope-hay ass-way it-tray o-bserved-say.\"\n\n2. In Pig Latin, the word \"eat\" would be \"eay-tay\".\n\n3. In Pig Latin, the word \"play\" would be \"ay-play\".\n\n4. In Pig Latin, the word \"cat\" would be \"c-tay\".\n\n5. In Pig Latin, the word \"on\" would be \"on-say\".\n\n6. In Pig Latin, the word \"the\" would be \"e-thay\".\n\n7. In Pig Latin, the word \"that\" would be \"hat-tay\".\n\n8.

However, here's a possible way to write it in Pig Latin:\n\n\"Her-way anctuary-ay the-way monks-bay eech-indifferent-smile-way the-way suffering-way bring-way of-way green-way away-way the-way to-way power-way kilometers-way of-way had-way of-way and-way eyes-way the-way atlantic-way in-way the-way tears-way by-way hundreds-way abyss-way\"\n\nNote that in Pig Latin, the word order is preserved, but the words are modified by moving the first consonant cluster to the end of the word and adding -ay. Also, words that start with a vowel are not modified, but simply have -say added to", "___________", "?\n\n(Note: You can use this Pig Latin translator to check your answer.)\n\nAnswer: Inway oofferingway, emthay it'sway inductionsfray foray aay unssay.", "", "________.\n\n(You can use any word you like for the blank, but you have to use Pig Latin to translate the sentence.)", "________.", "???\n\nThe answer is:\n\"andthay ere's bay igpay at's be some may a if did much done, evisnay osework notions to still impression-say.\"", "________________________________________________."], "accs": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "acc": 0.0, "eds": [67, 38, 134, 53, 383, 381, 49, 567, 84, 102, 730, 527, 95, 598, 112, 91, 61, 71, 86, 128, 235, 20, 144, 253, 152, 91, 216, 96, 302, 611, 69, 215, 249, 197, 94, 567, 544, 126, 97, 108, 62, 80, 85, 95, 94, 70, 69, 3185, 121, 63, 171, 138, 57, 66, 126, 634, 171, 215, 200, 170, 108, 98, 532, 47, 59, 74, 39, 194, 156, 608, 212, 113, 609, 205, 196, 90, 144, 586, 223, 431, 47, 71, 227, 143, 69, 114, 43, 49, 98, 71, 148, 134, 476, 100, 95, 63, 91, 77, 89, 90], "ed": 216.34}
