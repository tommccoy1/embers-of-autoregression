The given sentence in English is:\n\n\"their activity, of course, has changed but nevertheless, we know and feel that they are presents in the field and support the activists and regular people in the field.\"\n\nTo translate this sentence to Pig Latin, we need to follow the rules of Pig Latin, which are:\n\n1.

If the word starts with a vowel, add -way to the end of the word without changing the word.\n\nSo, let's translate the sentence word by word:\n\n1. \"their\" becomes \"eirhtay\" (move the consonant \"t\" to the end and add -ay)\n2. \"activity", "_______________\n\nAnswer: \"ayethsauceynay eesnay oosay oughay eevay ateway erifyay itay roughay oursaucesway.\"\n\nThis answer is correct, but I don't think it's a very good representation of Pig Latin.
