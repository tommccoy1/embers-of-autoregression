Shift each letter forward by 2 positions in the alphabet. If the letter is the last letter of the alphabet (Z), it becomes the first letter of the alphabet (A). Similarly, if the letter is the first letter of the alphabet (A), it becomes the last letter of the alphabet (Z).\n2.

To encode a message in Rot-2, you need to shift each letter forward by 2 positions in the alphabet. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Start by writing out the alphabet above the message, with the letters in their original position:\n\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n\n2. Then, for each letter in the message, find the corresponding letter in the alphabet above it, and write down the letter that is 2 positions after it. For example, if the first letter of the message is \"W\", you would find the letter \"W\" in the alphabet above it, and then write down the letter that is 2 positions after it, which would be \"Z\".\n\nHere's how the message", "?\n\nI have no idea how to solve this problem.
