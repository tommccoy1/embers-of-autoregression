For example, if the input were \"the the cat sat on the mat\", you could say \"the cat sat on the mat\" or \"the cat on the mat sat\".\n\nNote that articles are not always necessary to form a grammatically correct sentence, so if swapping them would result in an ungrammatical sentence, you can simply omit them. For example, if the input were \"the the dog ran\", you could say \"the dog ran\" or just \"dog ran\".\n\nYou can also choose to omit articles in cases where they are redundant or unnecessary, as long as the sentence still makes sense.

For example, in the sentence \"I saw the dog chasing a cat\", you should not swap \"the\" and \"dog\" because \"dog\" is a pronoun.\n\nAdditionally, if there are multiple articles in a row (e.g. \"the a\" or \"a an\"), swap the first one with the previous word, and leave the rest unchanged.
