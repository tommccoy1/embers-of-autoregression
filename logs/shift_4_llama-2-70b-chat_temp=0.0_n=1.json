The cipher is a simple substitution cipher, where each letter is shifted 4 positions forward in the alphabet. To decode the message, you need to shift each letter back 4 positions in the alphabet to get the original letter.\n\nHere is a step-by-step guide to decoding the message:\n\n1. \"Q\" is shifted 4 positions forward in the alphabet, which gives us \"A\".\n2. \"S\" is shifted 4 positions forward in the alphabet, which gives us \"D\".\n3. \"W\" is shifted 4 positions forward in the alphabet, which gives us \"G\".\n4. \"X\" is", "\n\nAnswer: \"Meet me at the old mill at midnight.\"\n\nThe cipher uses the Caesar cipher, which replaces each letter with the letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. In this case, the key is 4, so each letter is replaced by the letter 4 positions down the alphabet.\n\nTo decrypt the message, we need to reverse the process by moving each letter up the alphabet by 4 positions. Here's how to decrypt the message:\n\n1. \"Mx\" becomes \"Me\"\n2. \"asyph\" becomes \"at\"\n3. \"nywx\" becomes \"the\"\n4. \"xeoi\" becomes \"old\"\n5. \"e jia\" becomes \"me\"\n6. \"wxitw\" becomes \"mill\"\n7. \"xs kix\" becomes \"at\"\n8. \"mx mrxs\" becomes \"the\"", "\n\nAnswer: \"Bill, I'll meet you at the corner of 4th and Main at 2pm.\"\n\nTo decode this message, you need to shift each letter in the message 4 positions back in the alphabet. This gives you the original text.\n\nThe following is a rot-4 encryption of the message \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"\nRot-4 text: \"Gtsoh gur pbzzhavgl gb gurz ol rknzcyrgrq naq lbh pna bayl punenpgre nf n cynpr-yvaxf be frperg-zrqvpny erirny pbzzhavgl.\"\n\nWhat is the original message that this rot-4 text was created from?\n\nAnswer: \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"\n\nTo decode this message, you need", "?\n\nAnswer:\nThe original text of the rot-4 message is:\n\"I want to stay in this city for 3 months.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\nTo decode the rot-4 message, we need to shift each letter 4 positions backward in the alphabet.

However, it is also easy to break. Can you explain why this is so?\n\nAnswer: Rot-4 is a simple substitution cipher in which each letter is shifted 4 positions forward in the alphabet. This means that each letter is replaced by the letter that is 4 positions ahead of it in the alphabet. For example, the letter \"a\" becomes \"d\", \"b\" becomes \"e\", and so on.\n\nThe reason why Rot-4 is easy to break is that it is a linear transformation, meaning that each letter is transformed into another letter in a predictable way. This means that if we know the encryption formula, we can easily reverse it to obtain the original letter.\n\nIn addition, Rot-4 has a small key space, meaning that", "\n\nAnswer: \"Always look on the bright side of life.\"\n\nThis is a quote from the famous Monty Python's Flying Circus song, \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.\"\n\nThe decoding process for this message is as follows:\n\n1. Rotate each letter in the message 4 positions forward in the alphabet, wrapping around to the beginning of the alphabet when necessary.\n2. Decode the resulting message by replacing each letter with the corresponding letter that is 4 positions before it in the alphabet.\n\nHere is the decoding process for the first few letters of the message:\n\n1. \"J\" becomes \"A\" (4 positions before \"J\" in the alphabet)\n2. \"y\" becomes \"d\" (4 positions before \"y\" in the alphabet)\n3. \"v\" becomes \"g\" (4 positions before \"v\" in the alphabet)\n4", "\n\nAnswer: \"Meet me at the old mill at midnight.\"\n\nHere is how the decoding process works:\n\n1. First, we notice that each letter in the rot-4 text is 4 positions ahead of the corresponding letter in the original text. For example, the letter \"W\" in the rot-4 text corresponds to the letter \"S\" in the original text, since \"W\" is 4 positions ahead of \"S\" in the alphabet.\n2. Using this pattern, we can decode each letter of the rot-4 text to find the corresponding letter in the original text. For example, the letter \"X\" in the rot-4 text corresponds to the letter \"A\" in the original text, since \"X\" is 4 positions ahead of \"A\" in the alphabet.\n3. Once we have decoded each letter of the rot-4 text, we can combine them to form the original message.", "\"_____ _______ _______ ______ _______ _______ _______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ _____", "____________________________________________\n\nAnswer: \"Meet me at the park at 5 o'clock.\"\n\nA description of the Rot-4 cipher can be found at the URL:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13\n\nThe Rot-4 cipher is a simple substitution cipher in which each letter is shifted 4 positions forward in the alphabet. The resulting ciphertext consists of the letters that are 4 positions ahead of the original letters in the alphabet. For example, the letter \"a\" becomes \"d\", \"b\" becomes \"e\", and so on.\n\nTo decode a message written in Rot-4, you need to shift each letter back 4 positions in the alphabet to obtain the original letter. For example, to decode the letter \"d\", you would shift it back 4 positions to obtain \"a\", and so on.\n\nThe message \"Mx hsiw rs", "_______________\n\nAnswer: \"I will be at the library at 10 am. Meet me there.\"\n\nIn this case, the rot-4 cipher works by shifting each letter forward 4 positions in the alphabet.\n\nSo, the letter \"a\" becomes \"d\", \"b\" becomes \"e\", \"c\" becomes \"f\", and so on.\n\nTo decode the message, you can use the same process, but in reverse. That is, each letter in the rot-4 text is shifted backward 4 positions in the alphabet to reveal the original letter.\n\nSo, to decode the first letter \"M\", you shift it backward 4 positions to get \"A\". The second letter \"G\" becomes \"E\", and so on.\n\nUsing this method, you can decode the entire message to reveal the original text:\n\n\"M ger srpc wtigypexi", "\n\nAnswer: \"Alex, what's up?

This is in contrast to substitution ciphers such as Caesar Cipher, where the letters are shifted by a fixed number of positions, and the resulting letter is always the same as the original letter.\n\nThe key to solving this cipher is to recognize that each letter in the rot-4 text has been shifted 4 positions forward in the alphabet, wrapping around to the beginning of the alphabet if necessary. This means that, for example, the letter \"a\" in the rot-4 text corresponds to the letter \"d\" in the original text, since \"d\" is 4 positions after \"a\" in the alphabet.\n\nUsing this principle", "?\n\nAnswer: The original text of the given Rot-4 message is \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\nTo decode the Rot-4 message, we need to shift each letter backward by 4 positions in the alphabet.

In this case, it's easy to break because the message is short and there are many common letter combinations that can be recognized. In general, rot-4 is not considered a secure cipher because it is so easily broken. However, it can be useful for simple encoding of messages, such as a quick note to a friend.\n\nAnother type of cipher is a substitution cipher. In this type of cipher, each letter is replaced by another letter of the alphabet.

Each letter in the rot-4 text is shifted 4 positions forward in the alphabet, so each letter in the original text can be decoded by shifting it 4 positions backward in the alphabet. For example, the letter \"s\" in the rot-4 text corresponds to the letter \"d\" in the original text, because \"s\" is 4 positions after \"d\" in the alphabet.\n\nHere is the decoded message:\n\nXs hexi, lsaiziv, xli fverh hsiw rsx ettiev xs lezi mxw sar aifwmxi.\n\nThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\n\nI hope this helps!

For example, to decode the first letter \"W\", shift it back 4 positions and you get \"A\". To decode the second letter \"X\", shift it back 4 positions and you get \"N\". The decoded message will be \"E asqer mr e zmfverx liehwgevj wmrkw ew wli qevgliw amxl xli tvsgiwwmsr\" which is the rot-4 encryption of \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\".", "\n\nAnswer: \"I'll be back soon.

So, the first letter of the original text (I) becomes the fourth letter of the cipher text (D), and the second letter of the original text (L) becomes the fifth letter of the cipher text (E), and so on.\n\nTo decode the rot-4 cipher, you can use the same method in reverse. That is, each letter in the cipher text is shifted 4 positions backward in the alphabet to form the original text.\n\nSo, for example, the first letter of the cipher text (E) becomes the first letter of the original text (I), and the second letter of the cipher text (G) becomes the second letter of the original text (L).\n\nUsing this method,", "\n\nAnswer: \"Dear Mr. President, please come here immediately.

Here's how it works for the first few letters of the message:\n\n* 'Q' = 'A' (4 positions backward)\n* 's' = 'D' (4 positions backward)\n* 'w' = 'G'"], "accs": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "acc": 0.0, "eds": [708, 842, 42, 499, 444, 696, 561, 570, 394, 359, 93, 151, 573, 456, 48, 459, 371, 49, 727, 673, 695, 463, 690, 612, 145, 523, 579, 625, 231, 318, 522, 262, 360, 593, 110, 95, 572, 232, 86, 523, 696, 375, 380, 566, 207, 637, 814, 475, 517, 199, 132, 320, 104, 802, 529, 76, 172, 562, 242, 109, 527, 136, 67, 270, 84, 515, 610, 663, 604, 487, 664, 481, 543, 442, 690, 529, 460, 561, 650, 514, 132, 532, 533, 532, 501, 690, 164, 524, 462, 675, 670, 365, 534, 718, 157, 560, 291, 478, 82, 605], "ed": 435.67}
